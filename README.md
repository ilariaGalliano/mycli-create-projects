my ila21 CLI - How it works?
✅ The user is prompted to enter their name.
✅ The user is asked to select a language or framework.
✅ If "Angular" is selected, it asks for a project name. (V.1) -- in progress I'll do it for the others languages/frameworks and libraries
✅ It then runs ng new to create the project.
✅ The output is displayed in real time.

After cloning the project:
npm install
mycli
